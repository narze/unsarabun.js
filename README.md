# UnSarabun

UnSarabun is a command line utility for converting Thai numerals to Arabic numerals in text files. It uses a regular expression to match Thai numerals and replaces them with their equivalent Arabic numerals. UnSarabun reverts what Sarabun ITà¹™ did.

## Usage

To use UnSarabun, open your terminal and navigate to the directory that contains the text files you want to convert. You can then run the `unsarabun` command followed by the name of the file or a glob pattern that matches the files you want to convert. For example:

```sh
npx unsarabun file.txt
```

This command will convert Thai numerals to Arabic numerals in `file.txt` and save the modified contents back to the same file. If you want to convert multiple files, you can use a glob pattern. For example:

```
npx unsarabun "*.txt"
```

This command will convert Thai numerals to Arabic numerals in all text files with a `.txt` extension in the current directory and its subdirectories.

After running the command, UnSarabun will print a message for each file that it modifies. The message includes the name of the file and the number of characters that were changed.
